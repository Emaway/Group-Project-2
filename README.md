# Project Proposal

# Topic
The Right to Health Care for All

# Inspiration
  Health care is a fundamental human right. However, government policies do not reflect that. People in the United States are not guaranteed basic human needs such as clean water, food, housing, sanitation, due to our current health care system. Other countries around the world provide univeral health care for their population. How does the health care system in other countries compare to the health care system in the United States?
