# Project Proposal

# Topic
The Right to Health Care for All

# Data Sources
Global Health Observatory data repository from World Health Organization (2012 - 2018)

# Indicators
- Infant mortality rate (0-1 year) (WHO)
- Health expenditure (WHO)
- Basic sanitation services (WHO)

# Inspiration
  Health care is a fundamental human right. However, government policies do not reflect that. People in the United States are not guaranteed basic human needs such as clean water, food, housing, sanitation, due to our current health care system. Other countries around the world provide univeral health care for their population. How do those countries compare to the United States?
